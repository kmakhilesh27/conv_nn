## CS6910-Deep-Learning-Assignment-2
### Fundamentals of Deep Learning - Jan-May 2024 @ IITM

This repository contains the solutions to Assignment 2 for the Fundamentals of Deep Learning course.

### Part A

The `Part_A` directory comprises the implementation of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using the iNaturalist_12K dataset. This dataset consists of 1000 samples for each of the 10 classes in the training set and 200 samples for each of the 10 classes in the test set. For more details, go through the README in Part_A directory.

### Part B

In the `Part_B` directory, you'll find the implementation of fine-tuning a pretrained model using the iNaturalist dataset. The model utilized is the ResNet50 from the torchvision library. Fine-tuning involves freezing all the layers and appending a new final layer to accommodate the number of classes in the iNaturalist dataset. For more details, go through the README in Part_B directory.
